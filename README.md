## This is the official repository for <ins>CardioDiag</ins>. An externally validated and explainable machine learning framework for the diagnoses of diverse non-cardiac conditions.

CardioDiag have been proposed in four main manuscrips:

1. **Estimation of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Diagnosis from Electrocardiogram Features** <ins>Accepted by the international conference of computing in cardiology (CinC) 2024.</ins> [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17329)

2. **Electrocardiogram-based diagnosis of liver diseases: an externally validated and explainable machine learning approach** [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03717)

3. **Explainable machine learning for neoplasms diagnosis via electrocardiograms: an externally validated study** [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07737)
   
4. **Neuropsychiatric** [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14886)


In terms of input features, we use demographics such as age and gender, as well as ECG features such as RR-interval, PR-interval, QRS-duration, QT-interval, QTc-interval in milliseconds, P-wave axis, QRS-axis, as well as T-wave axis in degrees. All of the diagnoses are well-defined diagnoses by means of ICD10-CM codes.
